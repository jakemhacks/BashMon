# BashMon
BashMon is a very simple bash system security monitor I am writing for my home computer.
It is currently built for systems using journalctl and it has to be manually run. Eventually, I am going to make it compatible with other distros and there will be an install script to get it running all at once along with dependencies.

My goal is to make this into a fully functional, but lightweight, system monitor that will alert the user to any potential security risks in real time.

## Features
BashMon will be built to monitor, log, and alert:
- failed ssh connect attempts
- sudo commands
- system errors
- new and terminated services
- and many more to come!


## The Why
I like to tinker and make things.
I love the linux ecosystem and have wanted to learn bash scripting for a long time. So, this is my first significant project written entirely in bash.
I am also using this project to familiarize myself with other tools like journalctl and json parsing.
